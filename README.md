Current personal project that I have been working on. Takes Rocket League replays and uses Ballchasing API to parse them and gather information from them. Also currently working on an AI coach that will take Rocket League stats and tell players how to improve. Can be found at https://rocket-league-replay-tracker-1nbd.vercel.app/
